# Sentiment_Classifier
The script creates classes to handle sentiment analysis for book reviews, loads and processes a dataset, and uses various classifiers (Linear SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) to predict review sentiments. The classifiers are trained, tested, and evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1 scores. Finally, the model is tested on new examples and tuned with Grid Search.
